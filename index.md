I had been working as an educator for about 8 years previously and gained valuable teaching experience in both China and USA. During that time, My primary goal focused on improving students' academic performance and personal growth by enhancing their learning journey. 

But later on I realized that a family's financial situation plays an important part in creating a stable study environment for the students. And this compelled me to venture into financial industry where I started from financial planning for families during holidays and breaks. This transition in my career path allowed me to develop skills in data analytics, problem solving and communication, particularly in handling extensive data analysis tasks. Moreover, it underscored the profound impact of data-driven decision making. 

Movitated by a strong desire for personal growth and professional development, I decided to dive into data science by getting a master's degree in 2021. Now towards the end of this study journey, I am so glad that I made that brave move. With the necessary knowledge and skillsets in data mining and machine learning, I am able to use visualization and modeling to identify issues or roadblocks, address the problem or mitigate the risks by providing solutons or recommendations based on my domain knowledge and prior experience.
