In my previous career as an educator spanning over 8 years in both China and the USA, my focus was on enriching students' academic journey and personal growth. However, I soon realized the critical role of a family's financial stability in fostering a conducive learning environment. This realization led me to explore the financial industry, where I began by offering financial planning services during breaks and holidays.

This career transition has allowed me to further develop my skills in data analytics, problem-solving, and communication, particularly when it comes to handling complex data analysis tasks. It has also emphasized the significant influence of data-driven decision-making across different functionalities.

Motivated by a thirst for personal and professional growth, I pursued a master's degree in data science in 2021. As the completion of this journey, I reflect on the bold step I took and am grateful for the experiences gained, including my time at a startup in educational services.

Now, equipped with both academic knowledge and practical experience, I am thrilled to continue my journey in data science. I am eager to use my expertise in data mining and machine learning to tackle challenges, identify opportunities, and provide actionable insights based on my domain knowledge and past experiences.
